## The Task

Build a basic application from which two users can select their dishes from a supplied dinner menu, and are shown the total cost.

The application must use only HTML, CSS and JavaScript (no server-side code) and be built with high quality, maintainable code that is covered by test cases.

## Rules

This restaurant unfortunately has a number of rules about the meals that can be ordered.

* Each person must have at least two courses, one of which must be a main.
* Each diner cannot have more than one of the same course.
* There is only one piece of cheesecake left.
* Pierre the snobby waiter will not let you have prawn cocktail and salmon fillet in the same meal.

## Acceptance criteria

* The total bill amount is displayed when at least one dish has been selected.
* An error message is displayed when I try to select an invalid menu combination.
